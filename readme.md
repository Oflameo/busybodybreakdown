#Busybodybreakdown

Are you a community organizer looking for the person to talk to about why 
your water supply is full of giardia or why your roads are full of potholes?
Are you a capitalist that just wants to be left alone? Are you a researcher
that is tired of navigating the maze of poorly designed government websites
and pdf documents, and making phone calls to offices that close at 
inconvenient times just to find out who is running what? Busybodybreakdown
is the service you are looking for.

Busybodybreakdown is a service that allows you to query a directory about 
your local government by office, by responsibility, by district, by 
location or, by contact information, or by name. We will take the time to 
navigate the maze of ugly hard to read documents, and you will get back the
most direct route to politician or bureaucrat you need to talk to in your 
municipal or county government. Busybodybreakdown will set you free!
